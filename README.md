# 🚀 GitHub API Exploration with Postman

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was created to explore and practice API concepts using the GitHub REST API inside Postman.
It simulates real-world API workflows such as CRUD operations, authentication, error handling, pagination, and chained requests — along with a few support-case scenarios to demonstrate troubleshooting.

---

## 📊 Key Features

- ✅ CRUD Operations on GitHub repositories (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- 🔑 Authentication Handling with tokens and error scenarios
- 🔄 Query Parameters & Sorting to filter data
- 📑 Pagination & Chained Requests to fetch linked results
- ⚠️ Error Handling & Debugging with support-style cases
- 🧪 Automated Tests using Postman scripts and assertions

## 📁 Project Structure

| Folder Name                       | Description                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CRUD`                            | Covers the fundamental Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on GitHub repositories.                             |
| `Query Params & Sorting`          | Demonstrates how to use query parameters to filter and sort repository data.                                           |
| `Authentication & Error Handling` | Explores authentication with personal access tokens and handling errors like 401 and 404.                              |
| `Pagination & Chaining`           | Shows how to handle paginated results and use chaining to fetch next pages automatically.                              |
| `Chained Requests`                | Demonstrates request dependencies by passing data from one request into another.                                       |
| `Automation & Tests`              | Uses pre-request scripts and Postman tests to automate repo creation and validate responses.                           |
| `Support Scenarios`               | Includes real-world support-style API issues (unauthorized requests, invalid endpoints, rate limits, etc.) with fixes. |
